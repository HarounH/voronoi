# voronoi
Python implementation of Fortune's algorithm to find voronoi diagram of points.

Bewarned: This code is largely for demonstration purposes. It is also fairly inefficient since it uses symbolic expressions to deal with parabolas.
v1 - v3 have bugs as intended.
I'm working on v4 and v5 to also be able to handle voronoi diagram of lines.

Please take a look at the python equivalent of main() in v4 and v5 to understand how to use it.

Code utilizes classes from sympy.geometry. Requirements include sympy, numpy and matplotlib (for visualization)

Docstrings aren't available since this is a WIP, done entirely by a single individual :( Perhaps I have the cause and effect wrong?
